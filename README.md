##Family Oscar Competition

My wife's family competes in an annual Oscar pool, and they take it very seriously. Unsatisfied with the inefficiency of exchanging sheets of paper, I made it my mission to streamline the process for them this year. Now, participants can authenticate through Facebook to make their picks and then are able to view their standings live in realtime on Oscar night.

In building this app, I got to make use of three-way data-binding through Firebase and AngularJS. As winners were announced throughout the night, I would add add the data in Firebase, which would immediately update the users' view and model. No refresh required! The users' standings were then animated using D3.js
